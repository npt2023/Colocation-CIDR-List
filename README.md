# Colocation-CIDR-List
List of over 15,000 colocation ranges to be used to blacklist in squid cache

The goal of this list is to identify all webhosts and prevent them from connecting to your squid-cache open proxy. Please be sure to add more and report false positvies.

You can find CIDR ranges by ASN at https://hackertarget.com/as-ip-lookup/. You can find ranges by provider at http://isprangefinder.toolforge.org/. Copy and paste the list in vim and format it in vim by remapping a key to "0f D0j".
