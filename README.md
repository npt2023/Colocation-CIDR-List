# Colocation-CIDR-List
List of colocation ranges to be used to blacklist in squid cache

The goal of this list is to identify all webhosts and prevent them from connecting to your squid-cache open proxy. Please be sure to add more and report false positvies.

You can find CIDR ranges by ASN at https://isprangefinder.toolforge.org/. Copy and paste the list in vim and format it in vim by remapping a key to "0dfRdf D0j".
